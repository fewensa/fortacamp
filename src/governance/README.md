# Governance Events Bot Template

This bot monitors governance contracts that use the modular system of Governance contracts
available from OpenZeppelin. All of the possible emitted events are coded into the logic of the
bot, so that a developer only needs to update a few values in a data file to customize the
bot before deployment.
